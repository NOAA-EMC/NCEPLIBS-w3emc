Modification history
 29 Apr 2014 - original file (created w/ release of v2.2.0)
---

  The w3emc library was created by the splitting of the production w3lib into 
separate w3nco and w3emc libraries (c. 27 Dec 2012).

  As of the first authoring of these release notes (c. April 2014) the version 
of the w3emc library in use in production was v2.0.5.

---- History of Releases:

*** w3emc_v2.0.5 --> released c. 16 Apr 2013
 In production use thru April 2014.

*** w3emc_v2.1.0 --> tagged 06 May 2013
 This version was never separately implemented into production; it was included w/ the 
release of build v2.2.0 in April 2014.
 The changes for this library tag were mostly build-procedure related.
 
 Build procedure changes.
 ---- See nceplibs trac ticket #16, https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/trac/nceplibs/ticket/16
 * All source code was moved into the /libsrc directory.
 * An Autoconf configuration script, configure, was created.
 * A generic build script, make_w3emc_lib.sh, was created to build the three different
   precisions of the w3emc library.
 * A set of "standard" environment variable setup files were created and placed in the
   config-setup directory.
 * A README file for the new build procedure was created.
 ---- See nceplibs trac ticket #56, https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/trac/nceplibs/ticket/56
 * Corrected a problem with if-block syntax in the "configure.ac" script.
 * Updated the gfortran compiler setup files to prevent integer overflow compile errors.
 
 Code changes.
 ---- See nceplibs trac ticket #36, https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/trac/nceplibs/ticket/36
 * Removed "C$" comment characters from affected w3emc code as these are the sentinel
   characters for fixed source form conditional compilation in OpenMP.
 ---- See nceplibs trac ticket #50, https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/trac/nceplibs/ticket/50
 * Modified the "start.f" source code to allow preprocessing so the correct 
   subroutine name is used for non-AIX systems (not really an issue now the CCS 
   has been retired.)
 ---- See nceplibs trac ticket #51, https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/trac/nceplibs/ticket/51
 * This updated the nceplibs repository copy of "gblevents.f" to be brought up to date
   with an implementation by NCO via the ObsProc group.
 ---- See nceplibs trac ticket #56, https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/trac/nceplibs/ticket/56
 * Defined the iargc() function as an external in "args_mod.f" to prevent recursive
   call compile errors when gfortran is used.
 

*** w3emc_v2.2.0 --> released c. Apr 2014
 Implemented into production c. April 2014; Changes include modifications to build 
procedures, as well as source code updates in support of prepobs_prepdata release v3.0.0.

 Build procedure changes.
 ---- See nceplibs trac ticket #68, https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/trac/nceplibs/ticket/68
 * The build procedure was updated to use both the new vertical structure for the
   library implementations as well as use the module-load-defined environment
   variables, SIGIO_INC4 and SIGIO_LIB4, for the location of the dependent sigio
   include files and static library. 
 
 Code changes.
 4 April 2014  DKeyser and SMelchior Updated gblevents
   * Added new namelist switch "DOPMSL" which, when true, derives PMSL
     (mnemonic PMO), from station pressure (POB), station elevation (ZOB), and
     computed virtual temperature for surface reports in cases when reported
     PMSL is missing.  The drived PMSL either gets a quality mark (PMQ) of 3
     or inherits the station pressure quality mark (PQM), whichever is
     greater. The value of the PMSL indicator (new mnemonic "PMIN") is set to
     1 to denote PMSL was derived rather than observed.  The default for
     DOPMSL is false (normally only true in RTMA and URMA runs).
   * Reject calm surface marine winds if background u- or v- winds are
     greater than or equal to 5 m/s. 
   * Retain reports that lack observed station pressure.  A majority of the
     changes for this feature are in prepobs_prepdata.fd and in individual
     network prepobs_prepdata parm cards. 


*** w3emc_v2.3.0 --> released c. March 2017
 Expected production implemented c. May 2017; Updates support GFS/GDAS implementation
v14.0.0;  Source code changes are limited to gblevents.f routines so as to enable NEMSio
i/o;  Build changes are necessary to support use on Cray platforms.

 This upgrade affects only the gblevents.f subroutine, which is invoked in production via
the obsproc_prepdata program.  That program reads the GFS/GDAS forecast and writes its
values into prepbufr files for various network models.  Testing the use of the NEMSio
formatted inputs for these models was completed and found to have expected and acceptable
differences.


 Build procedure changes.
 ---- No coordinating nceplibs trac ticket, modifications occurred in nceplibs 
 development branch (see https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/trac/nceplibs/browser/...
 ...w3emc/branches/Fanglin.Yang/w3emc_v2.3.0).

 * The build procedure was updated to accomodate use on Cray platforms. See 
   BUILD.INSTRUCTIONS file for details.

 * On Cray systems, only the intel-sandybridge build is planned.  No
   instructions for cray-haswell build is listed here. (This is in support of the GFS cray 
   installation only, which doesn't reference cray-haswell libraries.)

   File changes and updates are summarized below.

   In root library directory ( N=new, M=modified):

   N  config-setup/wcoss-cray.setup  :: support for compilation on Cray
   N  config-setup/ifort-cray.setup  :: support for ifort compilation on Cray
   M  configure                      :: updated w/ v2.3.0 version specification
   M  configure.ac                   :: updated w/ NEMSIO_* (library, include) info
   N  make_w3emc_lib_wcoss.sh        :: replaces make_w3emc_lib.sh, adds NEMSIO content
   N  make_w3emc_lib_cray.sh         :: new build script for Cray environment, based on 
                                         make_w3emc_lib_wcoss.sh (uses setlib_cray.rc file)
   N  setlib_wcoss.rc                :: new resource file for make_w3emc_lib_wcoss.sh script
   N  setlib_cray.rc                 :: new resource file for make_w3emc_lib_cray.sh script
   M  README                         :: info on NEMSio content added

 * Library usage module files are contained in the ./modulefiles subdirectory.

   In ./modulefiles/

   N  w3emc/v2.3.0                   :: wcoss phase2 library usage modulefile
   N  w3emc/w3emc-intel/2.3.0        :: intel-sandybridge library usage modulefile

 Code changes.
 13 June 2016  Fanglin Yang, Russ Treadon updated gblevents.f
    * Hang Lei added NEMSIO to subroutine gblevn10 and removed all sigio capability.
      This update restroes GBLEVN10 for processing sigio input, and adds a new GBLEVN12
      for processing nemsio input. the input gfs file type sigio vs nemsio is now
      determined in the main program.  the code is also updated to remove bugs.
      subroutine SIGIO_MODPR is used to compute layer and interface pressure for NEMSIO
      input.
 22 February 2017  D Keyser & J Whiting 
    * In subroutine GBLEVN12, removed references to multiple input files, since only 1
      nemsio formatted input is needed (no interpolation is attempted; c.f.; what is
      done with sigio formatted inputs).
