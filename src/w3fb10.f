C> @brief Lat/long pair to compass bearing, gcd.
C> @author Peter Chase @date 1988-08-29

C> Given a pair of points (1) and (2) given by latitude and
C> longitude, w3fb10() computes the bearing and great circle distance
C> from point (1) to point (2) assuming a spherical Earth. The
C> north and south poles are special cases. If latitude of point
C> (1) is within 1e-10 degrees of the north pole, bearing is the
C> negative longitude of point (2) by convention. If latitude of
C> point (1) is within 1e-10 degrees of the south pole, bearing is
C> the longitude of point (2) by convention. If point (2) is within
C> 1e-6 radians of the antipode of point (1), the bearing will be
C> set to zero. If point (1) and point (2) are within 1e-10 radians
C> of each other, both bearing and distance will be set to zero.

C> @param[in] DLAT1 REAL Latitude of point (1) in degrees north.
C> @param[in] DLON1 REAL Longitude of point (1) in degrees east.
C> @param[in] DLAT2 REAL Latitude of point (2) in degrees north.
C> @param[in] DLON2 REAL Longitude of point (2) in degrees east.
C> @param[out] BEARD REAL Bearing of point (2) from point (1) in
C> compass degrees with north = 0.0, values from
C> -180.0 to +180.0 degrees.
C> @param[out] GCDKM REAL Great circle distance from point (1) to
C> point (2) in kilometers.
C>
C> @note According to the nmc handbook, the Earth's radius is
C> 6371.2 kilometers. This is what we use, even though the value
C> recommended by the smithsonian meteorological handbook is
C> 6371.221 km. (I wouldn't want you to think that I didn't know
C> what the correct value was.)
C>
C> @note Method: The poles are special cases, and handled separately.
C> otherwise, from spherical trigonometry, the law of cosines is used
C> to calculate the third side of the spherical triangle having
C> sides from the pole to points (1) and (2) (the colatitudes).
C> then the law of sines is used to calculate the angle at point
C> (1). A test is applied to see whether the arcsine result may be
C> be used as such, giving an acute angle as the bearing, or whether
C> the arcsine result should be subtracted from pi, giving an obtuse
C> angle as the bearing. This test is derived by constructing a
C> right spherical triangle using the pole, point (2), and the
C> meridian through point(1). The latitude of the right-angled
C> vertex then provides a test--if latitude (1) is greater than this
C> latitude, the bearing angle must be obtuse, otherwise acute.
C> If the two points are within 1e-6 radians of each other
C> a flat Earth is assumed, and the four-quadrant arctangent
C> function is used to find the bearing. The y-displacement is
C> the difference in latitude and the x-displacement is the
C> difference in longitude times cosine latitude, both in radians.
C> distance is then the diagonal.
C>
C> @note Fundamental trigonometric identities are used freely, such
C> as that cos(x) = sin(pi/2 - x), etc. See almost any mathematical
C> handbook, such as the c.r.c. standard math tables under 'relations
C> in any spherical triangle', or the national bureau of standards
C> 'handbook of mathematical functions' under section 4.3.149,
C> formulas for solution of spherical triangles.
C>
C> @note Double precision is used internally because of the wide
C> range of geographic values that may be used.
